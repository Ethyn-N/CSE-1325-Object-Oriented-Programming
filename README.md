# CSE 1325: Object-Oriented Programming Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio for **CSE 1325: Object-Oriented Programming**. This repository contains the projects I completed as part of my coursework, where I honed my skills in Java focusing on object-oriented concepts, class diagrams, collection classes, generics, polymorphism, and reusability. My projects include implementations of graphical user interfaces and multithreading, showcasing my ability to tackle complex programming challenges.

## Highlights of My Work
Below are some of the key projects I've worked on. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in object-oriented programming and my ability to implement functional and intuitive GUIs.

- **P01: Hello World** - A simple Java application that illustrates the basics of Java programming and console output.
- **P02: Clock Application** - A Java-based application dealing with time manipulation and basic object-oriented concepts.
- **P03: Card Deck Simulator** - Developed a card and deck application using collection classes and generics, showcasing my understanding of data structures.
- **P04 to P12**: These projects progressively increased in complexity, allowing me to explore advanced aspects of OOP, GUI development, and multithreading.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Practiced encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to build robust and scalable applications.
- **GUI Development**: Created user-friendly interfaces using Java Swing.
- **Multithreading**: Implemented concurrent programming techniques to ensure responsive applications.
- **Problem Solving**: Tackled challenging programming problems with innovative solutions.

## How to Navigate This Repository
- `P01`, `P02`, ..., `P12`: Each directory corresponds to a project.

## My Journey
Through this course, I've developed not only a strong foundation in object-oriented programming but also learned how to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. I invite you to explore my projects and code to get a sense of my coding style and problem-solving abilities.
